# 🔍 Silent Struggle Detector

**Silent Struggle Detector** is a lightweight feedback analysis tool that uncovers *hidden dissatisfaction* in user reviews — cases where users give **high ratings** but express **hesitation or uncertainty** in their comments.

It helps teams spot what star ratings alone fail to reveal.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

User ratings can be misleading.

Many users rate products or services **4–5 stars** out of politeness, while their written feedback includes phrases like:

- “It was okay”
- “Maybe”
- “I guess”
- “Could be better”

These *silent struggles* often go unnoticed, leading to:
- Missed product insights  
- Unaddressed user concerns  
- Increased churn over time  

---

## 🚀 Solution

A **rule-based feedback classification system** that combines:

- ⭐ **Numerical ratings**
- 📝 **Textual hesitation cues**

to flag feedback that looks positive on the surface but signals unresolved concerns underneath.

### Why rule-based?
- ✅ No black-box ML  
- ✅ Fully explainable logic  
- ✅ Fast, lightweight, and hackathon-ready

## 🧠 How It Works

### Classification Rules

| Category | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 🟡 **Silent Struggle** | Rating ≥ 4 **and** comment contains vague or hesitant language |
| 🔴 **Strong Negative** | Rating ≤ 2 with clear negative feedback |
| 🟢 **Clear Opinion** | Confident positive or negative feedback |

### Hesitation Cues
Words and phrases such as:
```

okay, maybe, guess, fine, somewhat, not sure, could be better

```

## 🧪 Demo Flow

1. Upload a feedback CSV file  
2. Automatically classify each entry  
3. Highlight **Silent Struggle** cases  
4. Download the analyzed dataset  

⏱️ End-to-end flow completes in seconds.

---

## 📂 Input Format

The tool expects a CSV file with the following columns:

```

id | rating | comment | date

```

Sample data is included in the repository for quick testing.

## 🎯 Impact & Use Cases

- Customer experience analysis  
- Product feedback monitoring  
- Survey and review analysis  
- Early detection of hidden dissatisfaction  

Helps teams act **before issues escalate**.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Advanced NLP & sentiment analysis  
- Multi-language support  
- Real-time feedback ingestion  
- Integration with survey platforms (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.)

---

## ✅ Why This Project Stands Out

- Explainable, rule-based logic  
- No heavy dependencies  
- Easy to demo, understand, and extend
